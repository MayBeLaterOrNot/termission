## About

This project is the successor of my old [serial-device-emulator](https://github.com/junian/serial-device-emulator). It's rewritten from the ground with cross-platform mindset.

## Features

- Cross-platform: available on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Manual device control
- Can act as Serial COM device
- Can act as TCP Client/Server
- Log everything
- Auto response using JS/C# interpreter with .NET CLR

## Installation

- Install [Virtual COM Port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_COM_port) driver such as [com0com](https://com0com.sourceforge.net).
- Download the **Termission** app and install it normally.
- Type in a string or hexadecimal message.
- Write Bot Script in C# by clicking **View** - **Device Bot**.
- The rest of the features should be self-explanatory.
